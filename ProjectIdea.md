Develop an application for tracking the history of user series. <br/>
The application will have the possibility to add for each user in a list the series which he/she prefers to watch and after that, it could also track its progress. Selecting a followed series the user will be able to see the list of seasons and also for each season the list of episodes, being able to mark as watched or unwatched, also in the right-hand side a progress status for the current show. <br/>
Like other features, he will be able to remove a show if he doesn't want to continue watching. <br/>
There will be 2 types of users: normal ones and an admin which will have an extra feature he will be able to add new shows. The admin features: see the list of shows, filter after name or a substring, add, remove and update each category. <br/>
 <br/>
 
In offline mode: <br/>
  - the user will be able just to see the last history, even if new episodes were released since her/his last connection. <br/>
  - the admin will be able to add new shows but only after online upload they will be visible for regular users. <br/>
